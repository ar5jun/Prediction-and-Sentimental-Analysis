                    <h5><b><u>Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Politics</u></b></h5><br>
                    <p>The popularity of Twitter platform in political scenarios is evident from the exponential growth
                        in the Twitter subscribers during elections. As an example in India, Twitter content related to
                        Lok Sabha elections recorded around 583 per cent growth between 2014 and 2019. Although,
                        majority of people sharing their opinions on Twitter are from urban backgrounds or in places
                        where there is internet connectivity and people are indulging in social media, this represents
                        the opinion of the whole country in many ways.
                        There are various approaches like the volumetric approach, sentiment approach, and social
                        network analysis approach that can predict election results through social media.The volumetric
                        approach, considers the volume of online followers, likes, and posts shared about an individual
                        party or electoral for predicting election results. In the sentiment analysis approach, an
                        aggregate of positive and negative sentiments of online posts about an electoral or political
                        party is considered for election prediction. In the social network analysis approach, the
                        networks of social media users who are supporting or discussing a couple of electoral or
                        political parties are analyzed.

                    <p><br>
                    <h5><b><u> Popularity of Twitter Platform in Election Prediction</u></b></h5><br>

                    Twitter platform is a preferred choice in social media based sentiment analysis due to the
                    restriction on the text content per tweet and hence an ease of analysis compared to other platforms.
                    Politics is increasingly becoming a hot topic of critical analysis in social media and Twitter hosts
                    a huge collection of opinions in this domain. Sentiment Analysis plays a big role in these posts
                    since it helps to decide the sentiment of people towards a specific political party or candidate and
                    hence the success or failure probabilities. This is really helpful for the parties to gear up their
                    election campaigns in a better way. This also helps people to grasp the sentiment which their fellow
                    citizens feel for a party. Also, For instance, if anyone wants to predict any election results, the
                    survey is conducted by going through a restricted group of individuals and asking their views on
                    different electoral and their respective political parties. Further results are evaluated on the
                    grounds of their opinions, and prediction of election results is done. All this process of the
                    offline survey cost so much while considering manpower, time, and money. It can, therefore, be
                    safely concluded that election prediction from social media platforms covers a varied and extensive
                    population, and save both time and men’s efforts.

                    <h5><b><u>The Future of Big Data Analytics in Elections</u></b></h5><br>
                    <p>
                        If current trends are any indication, future election campaigns will be further entrenched in
                        data analysis methods so as to glean the best approaches, efforts and results. Data analytics
                        will be used much after the campaigns as well, with it being an integral part of understanding
                        and flagging problems plaguing different population sections. Data analytics has evolved itself
                        to become the brain of every election campaign since the early 2000s. Data analytics helps the
                        election campaign committee understand the voters better and adapt their policies to their
                        sentiments, demonstrating the versatility of analytics platforms.

                    <h5><b><u>Big Data Analytics at Play in India’s General Elections 2019</u></b></h5><br>
                    <p>
                        Political parties and their IT cells were leveraging big data analytics to reach out to the
                        voters with appropriate messaging in General Elections 2019.In the general elections 2019 in
                        India, technology made it easier for political parties to gauge the mood of the voters and put
                        their best message forward. Political parties were leveraging big data analytics to gather
                        insights into voter preferences based on their socio-economic status, caste, local issues, and
                        various other parameters. Based on the voter sentiment and segments, customized election
                        campaigns with the most relevant messages and videos were created and pitched to the specific
                        target groups. Once the campaign was launched, data was then gathered to analyze its
                        effectiveness and tweak it further according to the response it generates.
